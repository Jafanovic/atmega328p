# Arduino Nano Tutorial
The Arduino Nano is a microcontroller board, based on the ATmega328P microcontroller by Atmel. The
Atmega328 comes with built-in bootloader, which makes it very easy to flash the board with your
code. Like all Arduino boards, you can program the software running on the board using a language
derived from C and C++. The easiest development environment is the Arduino IDE. The Nano is the
smallest board of the Arduino boards but has nearly the same datasheet like the Arduino Uno. Only
the power jack is missing and instead of a standard USB port the Nano has a Mini-B USB plug
